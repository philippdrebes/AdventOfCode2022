# Advent of Code 2022 - Rust Edition

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to my journey of solving the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges using Rust. I am new to Rust and this project aims to serve as a playground for me to explore the language and its features.

## Goals

1. **Learn Rust**: The main objective is to become more familiar with Rust, its syntax, and ecosystem.
2. **Problem-Solving**: The Advent of Code challenges present an excellent opportunity to improve problem-solving skills.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
.
├── README.md
├── day01
│   ├── Cargo.lock
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   ├── input.txt
│   ├── src
│   └── target
├── day02
│   ...
├── day03
│   ...
└── day25 (potentially)
```

- Each `dayXX` directory represents the challenge for that day.
- `Cargo.lock` and `Cargo.toml` are Rust's dependency management files.
- `input.txt` contains the problem's input data.
- `src` contains the Rust source code files.

## Usage

To run the code for a specific day:

1. Navigate to the corresponding `dayXX` directory.
2. Run `cargo build` to compile the project.
3. Run `cargo run` to execute the compiled binary.

## Note

- The solutions may not be the most efficient or idiomatic Rust code, but the main focus is on learning and problem-solving.
- Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements.
